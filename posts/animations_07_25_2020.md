Yesterday turned into a catch-up day (why does Anki not have an automatic save feature :(... it caused me to lose 4 hours of work when my computer crashed, yay!).

For today, here's a short fire animation (as you can tell I've never drawn fire before):

I tried connecting two different drawings of fire together, but it was difficult because Pencil2D does not allow you to adjust the onion skin settings (to, for example, only show the layers directly before and after), so I found it a challenge to identify which layer was the one before and the one after through 10 overlapping layers.

Anyways, tomorrow I'll try drawing some clouds, although that may take a long time to make.

Of other note, I spent some time in Minecraft this afternoon recreating the :catlove: emoji with my friend:

Here's the original:

Pretty similar, if I do say so myself : ).

As a final afterthought, I did write a short piece for a random competition, although I never got around to editing it in time to submit it. I'll post again (sometime later) with it, and hopefully in the future I can be more consistent with writing *something* every day.

(Also, if anyone wants to write on my [trashy] blog, just dm me... one day this won't just be me showing off how much I fail)
