Cel animation is fun!

Using Pencil2D (for animating) and VNC (to connect iPad to computer)

First project: a person flying with a balloon, and then falling after hitting a wall?

My inspiration came from watching a balloon fly up... and up... and up... And I wondered what it would look like if it could carry a person

Then, of course, I didn't want the person to just fly out of the frame, so I had them hit a wall (it was also convenient for me to add a follow through :D), and then the person let go of the balloon and fall down, before finding a new one. Once they land on the ground and find a new balloon, they return to their original position (because I'm bored).

And finally, because balls are fun, here's a short animation of a water balloon hitting a wall:
